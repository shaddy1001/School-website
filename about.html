          <p>
            Our mission at Blue Bird school is to develop the unique abilities
            and potential of each child by offering an enriched educational
            program. We strive for excellence through a hands-on approach. Rich
            traditions rooted in our innovative curriculum grow productive,
            caring, and intellectually curious citizens.

          <p>
            We have a culture that is modern, relevant, and inspires students to
            have a brighter future. We are determined in our approach to
            learning, are creative in our thinking, and bold in our ambitions.

        <div class="s32">
          <p>
            We, at Blue Bird School, follow a child-centered educational
            approach. We make sure that it is based on scientific observations
            from birth to adulthood. We believe that a child is naturally
            curious and is capable of initiating learning in a supportive and
            thoughtfully prepared environment.
